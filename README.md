# Web Data Extraction Script

This Python script demonstrates how to use the Induced API for web data extraction. It sends a request to extract data from a specified URL and polls the API until the extraction process is completed. The script handles the request, polling, and error-checking processes.

## Overview

The script performs the following tasks:
1. Sends a POST request to start the data extraction process from a given URL.
2. Polls the API to check the status of the extraction process.
3. Prints the extraction status and results once the process is completed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

## Installation

1. **Install the `requests` library**:
   ```bash
   pip install requests

## Usage

1. **Update the script**: Replace the placeholder API key and URL in the script with your own values.

2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python extract_data.py
